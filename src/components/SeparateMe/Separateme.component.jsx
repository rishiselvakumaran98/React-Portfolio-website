              When developing software applications, I always drive the extra mile to carefully research and look closely for use cases 
              that needs to satisfied for the users of my applications and this drives me to make compelling software applications
              that encompasses clients's needs carefully while delivering reusable components for future development needs. 
              Every application has its own unique set of use cases, and it is the duty of a good developer to identify them,
              and fix them ASAP. As a software developer thats where I shine in fulfilling them. As philosophers say, travel alone to reach fast, 
              travel together to reach further, I aspire to reach further in my career by working in a team setting 
              and I always look for opportunities to learn from my teammates. I also spearhead projects and make sure that 
              my team moves in the pace that is best suited for everyone and also achieve goals that help our project and team standout from the rest. 
              As a developer, who highly values ethics in Technology, I also pay careful attention to the right features and flexibility for clients/users 
              to modify the state of the application such as being able to delete or update their posts in a blogging website (Check my CS-Insiders). 
              Hence these characteristics give me an edge in practicing the best software techniques while also constantly updating myself
              to develop the best applications.
