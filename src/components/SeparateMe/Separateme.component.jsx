            When developing software applications, I always drive the extra mile to carefully research 
            and examine use cases that need to satisfied for users of my applications. This persistence 
            drives me to make compelling software applications that encompass clients's needs carefully 
            while delivering reusable components for future development needs. Every application has its own 
            unique set of use cases, and it is the duty of a good developer to identify them, and fix them 
            ASAP. As a software developer, that is where I shine in fulfilling them. As philosophers say: 
            travel alone to go fast, travel together to go further. I aspire to reach further in my career 
            by working in a team setting and I always look for opportunities to learn from my teammates. 
            I also spearhead projects and make sure that my team moves in the pace that is best suited for 
            everyone. With this approach, my team and I have achieved goals that have helped our project 
            and team stand out from the rest. As a developer who highly values ethics in technology, I also 
            pay careful attention when adding features so that I can provide flexibility for clients/users to 
            modify the state of the application such as being able to delete or update their posts in a blogging 
            website (Check my CS-Insiders). Hence, these characteristics give me an edge in practicing the best software 
            techniques while also constantly updating myself to develop the best applications.
