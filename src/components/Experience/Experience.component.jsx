                <h4 class="container">Teaching has always been my passion, and it has been simply amazing on how much I learn by trying to teach and explain the basic principles and foundations in programming to my students
                    . Being a teaching assistant has never been an easy task, and I have gained many soft skills on how to communicate technical ideas effectively as well as answer some of the most intriguing questions posed by students. 
                    Not to mention, this experience has colossally helped me develop my programming skills in python further by encouraging me to write labs and even small projects for students to program and learn in CSCI 1133 - Intro to programming. 
                    Since the beginning of 2021 till May 2021, I have also mentored and taught students in CSCI 2041: Advanced programming Principles using OCaml.

                    The past 2 years that I dedicated for my national service in Singapore from 2017-2019, has been a vital learning journey that shaped me to be who I am today. Military Service has been pivotal in coaching important life skills as well as helping me gain leadership qualities, professionalism and pride for my nation. I also learned to value things that we sometimes take for granted in a civilian society, such as a sheltered place to live, good food to eat, and sleeping without insect bites (Well applies in many cases).
